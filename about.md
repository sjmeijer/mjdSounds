This is site was designed as a way to learn some basics of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), for use with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses mostly the basic templates, with nothing too fancy going on.

You can find the source code for this site at [github.com/sjmeijer/mjdSounds](https://github.com/sjmeijer/mjdSounds/tree/gh-pages). I mostly followed the tips described at [this blog](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/).
